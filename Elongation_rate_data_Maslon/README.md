Scripts for merging elongation rate data reported by Maslon et al. (2019) (transcript information from Ensembl) and own data from ChMeRIP-seq (m6A levels). 
m6A levels were calculated in a protein-coding transcriptome obtained from Ensembl (150,000 genes). 
Start/End coordinates from transcriptome list were redefined to include TSS-2Kb and TTS+1Kb.
