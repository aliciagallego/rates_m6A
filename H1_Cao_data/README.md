Scripts for merging H1c histone and H1d histone data reported by Cao et al. (2013) (WT mESCs) and own elongation rate data (4sU-DRBseq). 
Elongation rates were calculated in a protein-coding transcriptome obtained from RefSeq (5351 genes). 
Start/End coordinates from transcriptome list were redefined to include TSS-2Kb and TSS+2Kb (region around the promoter).
