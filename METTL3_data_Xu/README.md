Scripts for merging METTL3 data reported by Xu et al. (2021) in WT mESCs, and own elongation rate data (4sU-DRBseq). 
Elongation rates were calculated in a protein-coding transcriptome obtained from RefSeq (5351 genes). 
Start/End coordinates from transcriptome list were redefined to include TSS±2Kb and TTS±2Kb.
